I am currently serving as an Assistant Professor in the [Internet of Things Thrust](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/information-hub/internet-of-things/) at the [Information Hub](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/information-hub/) of the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/).
Before joining HKUST-GZ, I worked as a Researcher at Huawei Hong Kong Research Center from October 2020 to August 2023. I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in August 2020, under the supervision of [Prof. Qian Zhang](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~qianzh/). I obtained my B.S. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Shanghai Jiaotong University in 2015.

## Research Interests

I am broadly interested in challenging problems with practical impact, with particular focuses on networked and cyber-physical systems.

My past research spans the areas of intelligent sensing, cyber-physical security, internet of things, network configuration management and their intersection with machine learning techniques.
Relevant papers have been published in conferences in the fields of computer networks, ubiquitous computing, and machine learning, including SIGCOMM/UBICOMP/AAAI/INFOCOM/USENIX Security/....

I am currently interested in exploring the practical challenges and requirements encountered in the design, management, and evolution of networks and cyber-physical systems. My goal is to utilize cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence to develop supportive frameworks, systems, and algorithms, which aim to achieve a range of objectives, including but not limited to:

- Accelerate intent-based system design.
- Achieve system behavior management based on specification requirements.
- Streamline the complexity of cognition and interaction in the design, management, and evolution of networks and cyber-physical systems.
- etc...

I also keep open-minded to cross-disciplinary problem domains and look forward to academic collaboration. Email me if you'd like to chat.
