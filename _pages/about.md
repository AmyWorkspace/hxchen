I am currently serving as an Assistant Professor in [Internet of Things (IoT) Thrust](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/hubs-and-thrust-areas/information-hub/internet-of-things/), Information Hub, [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/).
Before joining HKUST(GZ), I worked as a Researcher at Huawei Hong Kong Research Center (HKRC) from 2020 to 2023.
I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in 2020, under the supervision of [Prof. Qian Zhang](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~qianzh/).
I obtained my B.S. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2015.

<!-- I always welcome motivated students to do long-term research with me. Email me if you'd like to chat! -->

## Research Interests

- Ubiquitous Intelligence
- Cyber-Physical Security
- Intent‑driven System Operation and Management
- AIoT (Artificial Intelligence of Things)

I always welcome motivated PhD/MPhil/Research Interns/Visitors to work with me at HKUST(GZ).

My past research spans the areas of intelligent sensing, cyber-physical security, internet of things, network configuration management and their intersection with machine learning techniques.
Relevant papers have been published in conferences in the fields of computer networks, ubiquitous computing, and machine learning, including SIGCOMM/UBICOMP/AAAI/INFOCOM/USENIX Security/....

I am currently interested in exploring the practical challenges and requirements encountered in the design, management, and evolution of networks and cyber-physical systems. My goal is to utilize cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence to develop supportive frameworks, systems, and algorithms, which aim to achieve a range of objectives, including but not limited to:

- Accelerate intent-based system design.
- Achieve system behavior management based on specification requirements.
- Streamline the complexity of cognition and interaction in the design, management, and evolution of networks and cyber-physical systems.
- etc...
