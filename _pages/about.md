I am a researcher in Theory Lab, 2012 Labs, Huawei Hong Kong Research Center since Oct. 2020. I am currently working on network configuration management and its intersections with machine learning.
Before joining Huawei, I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in Aug. 2020, supervised by [Prof. Qian Zhang](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~qianzh/). During my Ph.D. study, I worked on topics in the intersection of intelligent IoT sensing and security. 
I received my B.S. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Shanghai Jiaotong University in 2015. 

## Interests
- Network Configuration Management
- Intelligent Sensing (Mobile/Wearable/Wireless Sensing) 
- Machine Learning Algorithms
- Physical-layer Security
